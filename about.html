            <h3>What I've done:</h3>
            <p>I created a game from scratch as I haven't seen a game like this before.<br>
            I started with the idea of a poor PacMan clone, but upon issues with collision when <br>
            there were walls put within the outer walls, I had to make a new game on the top of my head.<br>
            This is the reason why my game includes food as it was from when it was going to be PacMan.</p>
